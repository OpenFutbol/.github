# OpenFutbol

OpenFutbol is an open-source platform connecting pickup soccer communities across cities worldwide. We believe soccer has the power to bring people together, build communities, and create lasting friendships through the beautiful game.

## üåç Mission

OpenFutbol's mission is two-fold:
1. To form an open pick-up soccer collective that fosters open innovation and collaboration.
2. To create and incubate open-source communities for pick-up soccer organizations.

Our mission is to make pickup soccer accessible, visible, and community-driven in every city. Starting in Chicago and expanding globally, we provide tools and platforms for local soccer organizers to connect players and build vibrant futbol communities.

> By setting up a GitHub organization repository, the organization can share their goals, resources, and plans with the public and make it easier for potential members to find them. Additionally, members can provide feedback and suggest changes to the organization's plans, which can help the organization refine their strategies and improve their services. Furthermore, members can also contribute code and other resources to the repository, allowing the organization to benefit from the collective expertise of the open-source community.

## üîÆ Vision

OpenFutbol's vision is to create an open-source framework and space to promote collaboration, innovation, and acceleration toward pick-up soccer as a public good in global and local communities. We envision doing this through driver-projects, which can then serve as frameworks to incubate organizations in open-source ways.

## What is a Driver Project?

OpenFutbol's Driver Projects are real-world open community pickup soccer initiatives that help guide our development efforts and pilot our mission & vision. Stakeholders in local and global communities can then advocate, mandate, implement, and use our frameworks and standards in their local contexts.
