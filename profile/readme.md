# OpenFutbol
## Mission
OpenFutbol's mission is two-fold 
1. To form an open pick-up soccer collective that fosters open innovation and collaboration.
2. To create and incubate open-source communities for pick-up soccer organizations.

>By setting up a GitHub organization repository, the organization can share their goals, resources, and plans with the public and make it easier for potential members to find them. Additionally, members can provide feedback and suggest changes to the organization's plans, which can help the organization refine their strategies and improve their services. Furthermore, members can also contribute code and other resources to the repository, allowing the organization to benefit from the collective expertise of the open-source community.


## Vision
OpenFutbol's vision is to create an open-source framework and space to promote collaboratation, innovation, and acceleration toward pick-up soccer as a public good in global and local communities. We envsion doing this through driver-projects, which can then serve as frameworks to incubate organizations in open-source ways.

## Driver Project
OpenFutbol Driver Projects are real-world open community pickup soccer initiatives that help guide our development efforts and pilot our mission & vision. Stakeholders in local and global communities can then advocate, mandate, implement, and use our frameworks and standards in their local contexts.
