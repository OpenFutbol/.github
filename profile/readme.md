# OpenFutbol

Open-source platform applying FAIR principles to community soccer infrastructure.

## Origin

OpenFutbol started as a project by [Chicago Neighborhood Soccer](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-neighborhood-soccer/), now operating as [NBHD Soccer](https://nbhdsoccer.github.io), an Illinois 501(c)(3) nonprofit. What began as organizing pickup games in Chicago's west and south side neighborhoods grew into a vision for open-source tools that any city could use.

The idea is simple: soccer players and programmers working together to build technology that serves communities often overlooked by commercial platforms.

## What We're Building

OpenFutbol makes existing soccer infrastructure more discoverable. The platform doesn't favor any organization—it surfaces what already exists and bridges technology gaps for groups that lack digital resources.

We apply FAIR principles to community sports:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Findable** | Organizations discoverable by search, maps, and directories |
| **Accessible** | No login required, mobile-friendly, open data |
| **Interoperable** | Standard formats, linkable resources, API-ready |
| **Reusable** | Fork for your city, MIT license, documented code |

## Chicago: Driver Project

Chicago is the first implementation and proving ground. The platform serves neighborhoods like Pilsen, Little Village, Humboldt Park, Bridgeport, and McKinley Park—communities with strong soccer culture that deserve better digital infrastructure.

**Live**: [openfutbol.github.io](https://openfutbol.github.io)

### Available Now

- Interactive neighborhood map
- Organization directory
- Game listings
- Youth programming directory

### Coming Soon

- Meetup API integration
- Search and filters
- Event calendar
- Multi-city architecture

## Expanding to Other Cities

The codebase is city-agnostic by design. Fork the repo, update the neighborhood data, and deploy for your community. The goal is to bring these tools to major cities with active pickup soccer scenes.

If you're organizing in another city and want to implement OpenFutbol, the Chicago implementation serves as your framework.

## Technology

Simple stack, easy to fork:

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap
- GitHub Pages with Jekyll
- MIT License

No frameworks, no dependencies to manage. Just clone and customize.
